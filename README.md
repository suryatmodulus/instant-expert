## Introduction

This project introduces the Instant Expert; a lightweight web component that will allow the stable and efficient integration of a natural language question answering system to web-based information systems in any domain. The component consists of the user input (i.e. text, voice, multi-selection), question processing, and user interface modules. Two use cases are developed and provided to demonstrate the componentâ€™s features, benefits, and usage. The goal of this project is to pave the way for next-generation information systems by mitigating the challenges of developing voice-enabled and domain-informed smart assistants for the associates of any domain.

## How To Use

The InstantExpert do not require any frameworks and can be integrated into any website using pure HTML. To use it, please follow the steps below.

- Download the library and import InstantExpert as a script:
```html
<script src="lib/instant-expert.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

- Include the web component <instant-expert> in your html and set the 'engine' to your webhook:
```html
<instant-expert id="bing-expert" engine="https://expert-component-example-bing.herokuapp.com/"></instant-expert>
```

That's it! You can now use your virtual expert.

### Optional Configurations

To add a list of example questions to allow the users to browse the questions that your expert is capable of answering, set the questions and their categories as shown below in JavaScript.

```js
var expert = document.getElementById("bing-expert");
var questionList = [
                      ["What is machine learning?",               "Definition"],
                      ["What's a troodontidae?",                  "Definition"],
                      ["Is there such a thing as Satire comedy?", "Definition"],
                      ["What RNA stands for?",                    "Definition"],
                      ["What's the meaning of hydrograph?",       "Definition"],

                      ["Which algorithms have been used for predictive modeling?",    "Reference"],
                      ["How many medals did the US win in the 2012 summer Olympics?", "Reference"],
                      ["When did Berlin host the Olympics?",                          "Reference"],
                      ["Who played Morpheus in The Matrix",                           "Reference"],
                      ["How tall is Barack Obama?",                                   "Reference"],

                      ["How to find happiness?",                  "Conversational/Fun"],
                      ["What's the first rule of Fight Club?",    "Conversational/Fun"],
                      ["What does the fox say",                   "Conversational/Fun"],
                      ["Can you pass the Turing test?",           "Conversational/Fun"],
                      ["How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?", "Conversational/Fun"]
                   ];
expert.setQuestions(questionList);
```

There are a number of attributes to customize the InstantExpert web component which below table summarizes.

| Attribute Name      | Expected Value | Description  |
| -------------       |:-------------: | :------------|
| engine              | string         | The webhook link that will be used to make a POST request to get the answer for user's question. The question text will be passed with the parameter named "searchValue". As the response, it expects a JSON file with the the field "resultText" |
| engineDataKey       | string         | The key name to pass the question text to the engine. The question will be passed to the engine as a parameter with a POST request in this format: {engineDataKey: questionText}. The default is 'question'.|
| engineResponseKey   | string         | The key name to access the answer text in the JSON object returned by the engine. The default is 'resultText'.|
| logo-src            | string         | The link for the source of the logo. |
| logo-hidden         | boolean        | Toggle logo's visibility. True=visible, false=hidden |
| textbox-placeholder | string         | The placeholder text that will be displayed on the input text box. |
| no-question-list    | boolean        | Disable the question list. If true, question list will not be displayed. |
| no-voice            | boolean        | Disable voice input. If true, voice input will be disabled.  |
| expert-button-src   | string         | The link for the source of the always-visible button to toggle the expert component. |

#### Notes

* The link of the 'engine' webhook should use 'https' if voice-input is desired. If not, regular 'http' connection can be used.
* If the HTTP request to the webhook needs modification, we encourage you to modify the source code of the Instant Expert Web Component and use it as you please.

## Use Cases

### Q&A Mode

### Knowledge Engine Mode (External)

#### Microsoft Cognitive Services - Project Answer Search
We have developed an open-source example use case to use Expert Web Component to ask natural language questions to get factual responses using [the Project Answer Search by Microsoft Cognitive Services Lab](https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/en-us/project-answer-search).

- To test this example by yourself, just download [examples/engine/bing-bot/use-case](examples/engine/bing-bot/use-case) and run *index.html* on supported browsers.
  - It uses an engine that is hosted on Heroku for free, and it is subject to limitations.
  - The first time a question is asked, system might take few seconds to wake up Heroku. After that, the responses should be instantaneous.
  - It is only intended for demonstration purposes, and not advised and allowed for production use.
  
- To modify/host this example yourself, please follow the directions on [examples/engine/bing-bot/bot-source](examples/engine/bing-bot/bot-source)
